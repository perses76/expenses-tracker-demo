# Expenses tracker test project

### Write a simple expenses tracker application

* The user must be able to create an account and log in.
* When logged in, user can see, edit and delete expenses he entered.
* Implement at least three roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
* When an expense record is entered, each one has: date, time, description, amount, comment
* User can filter expenses.
* User can print expenses per week with total amount and average day spending.
* Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
* I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is not an option.
* REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you don’t know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
* You need to be able to pass credentials to both the webpage and the API.
* In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
* Bonus: unit and e2e tests!
* You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.

NOTE: Please keep in mind that this is the project that will be used to evaluate your skills. We will evaluate the project as if you are delivering it to a customer. We expect you to make sure that the app is fully functional and doesn’t have any obvious missing pieces. The deadline for the project is 2 weeks from today.
